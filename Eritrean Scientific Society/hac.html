            <h2>Agronomy</h2>
            <p>
                Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants in agriculture for food, fuel, fiber, and
                land
                restoration. It is both a humanitarian career and a scientific one. Agronomy has come to encompass work in the
                areas of
                plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of
                sciences like
                biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Agronomists of today are involved with many
                issues,
                including producing food, creating healthier food, managing the environmental impact of agriculture,
                distribution of
                agriculture, and extracting energy from plants.[1] Agronomists often specialise in areas such as crop rotation,
                irrigation and drainage, plant breeding, plant physiology, soil classification, soil fertility, weed control,
                and insect
                and pest control.<br>
                This area of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops under various conditions.
                Plant
                breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including corn,
                soybeans,
                and wheat. It has also led to the development of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain called
                triticale was
                produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. Triticale contains more usable protein than does either rye or wheat.
                Agronomy
                has also been instrumental in fruit and vegetable production research.<br>Agronomists use biotechnology to
                extend and expedite the development of desired characteristic. Biotechnology is
                often a lab activity requiring field testing of the new crop varieties that are developed.<br>
        
                In addition to increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology is increasingly being applied for novel uses other
                than
                food. For example, oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils, but it can be modified
                to
                produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals.

            <h2>Animal Science</h2>
            <p>
                Animal science (also bioscience) is described as "studying the biology of animals that are under the control of
                humankind". It can also be described as the production and management of farm animals.<br>
                Professional education in animal science prepares students for career opportunities in areas such as animal
                breeding,
                food and fiber production, nutrition, animal agribusiness, animal behavior and welfare. Courses in a typical
                Animal
                Science program may include genetics, microbiology, animal behavior, nutrition, physiology, and reproduction.
                Courses in
                support areas, such as genetics, soils, agricultural economics and marketing, legal aspects, and the environment
                also
                are offered. All of these courses are essential to entering an animal science profession

            <h2>Horticulture</h2>
            <p>
                The Department of Horticulture studies on the science and art of the development, sustainable production,
                marketing, and use of high-value,
                intensively cultivated food and ornamental plants. Horticultural crops are diverse; they include annual and
                perennial
                species, delicious fruits and vegetables, and decorative indoor and landscape plants. These specialty crops help
                sustain
                and enrich our lives by providing nutritious food, enhancing the beauty of our homes and communities and
                reducing our
                carbon footprint. <br>
                Horticulture also contributes to quality of life, and the beauty, sustainability and rehabilitation of our
                environment
                and the human condition. Environmental horticulture (i.e., the “green industry”), is composed of careers in
                greenhouse production, wholesale
                brokers, commercial nurseries, garden centers, florists and landscape design and construction firms, as well as
                private
                and community gardens, municipal parks and state or national reserves.

                data in order to improve its overall efficiency both organization and customer wise. A vehicle

            <h2>Veterenary</h2>
            <p>
                A veterinarian (vet), also known as a veterinary surgeon or veterinary physician, is a professional who
                practices
                veterinary medicine by treating diseases, disorders, and injuries in non-human animals. In many countries, the
                local nomenclature for a veterinarian is a regulated and protected term, meaning that members of
                the public without the prerequisite qualifications and/or licensure are not able to use the title. In many
                cases, the
                activities that may be undertaken by a veterinarian (such as treatment of illness or surgery in animals) are
                restricted
                only to those professionals who are registered as a veterinarian.

            <h2>Agricultural Economics</h2>
            <p>
                Agricultural economics is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in
                optimizing
                the production and distribution of food and fiber. Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that
                specifically dealt with land usage, it focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good soil
                ecosystem.
                Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader.
                Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional
                economics. Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics,
                econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food policy,
                agricultural policy, and environmental policy.
