                Agricultural economics is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic
                theory in
                optimizing
                the production and distribution of food and fiber. Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics
                that
                specifically dealt with land usage, it focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good
                soil
                ecosystem.
                Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much
                broader.
                Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with
                conventional
                economics.[1][2][3][4] Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in
                economics,
                econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food
                policy,
                agricultural policy, and environmental policy.

                Agricultural economics is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic
                theory in
                optimizing
                the production and distribution of food and fiber. Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics
                that
                specifically dealt with land usage, it focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good
                soil
                ecosystem.
                Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much
                broader.
                Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with
                conventional
                economics.[1][2][3][4] Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in
                economics,
                econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food
                policy,
                agricultural policy, and environmental policy.

                Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants in agriculture for food, fuel,
                fiber,
                and
                land
                restoration. It is both a humanitarian career and a scientific one. Agronomy has come to encompass work
                in
                the
                areas of
                plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination
                of
                sciences like
                biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Agronomists of today are involved
                with
                many
                issues,
                including producing food, creating healthier food, managing the environmental impact of agriculture,
                distribution of
                agriculture, and extracting energy from plants.[1] Agronomists often specialise in areas such as crop
                rotation,
                irrigation and drainage, plant breeding, plant physiology, soil classification, soil fertility, weed
                control,
                and insect
                and pest control.<br>
                This area of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops under various
                conditions.
                Plant
                breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including
                corn,
                soybeans,
                and wheat. It has also led to the development of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain called
                triticale was
                produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. Triticale contains more usable protein than does either rye or
                wheat.
                Agronomy
                has also been instrumental in fruit and vegetable production research.<br>Agronomists use biotechnology
                to
                extend and expedite the development of desired characteristic. Biotechnology is
                often a lab activity requiring field testing of the new crop varieties that are developed.<br>

                In addition to increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology is increasingly being applied for novel
                uses
                other
                than
                food. For example, oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils, but it can be
                modified
                to
                produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals.

                humankind". It can also be described as the production and management of farm animals.<br>
                Professional education in animal science prepares students for career opportunities in areas such as
                animal
                breeding,
                food and fiber production, nutrition, animal agribusiness, animal behavior and welfare. Courses in a

                Science program may include genetics, microbiology, animal behavior, nutrition, physiology, and

                Courses in
