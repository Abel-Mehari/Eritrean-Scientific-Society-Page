                    <h1>Design and Layout</h1>
                    My name is Abel Mehari, age 27 years old. I am currently working in the design and layout of this website and building of the EriSci android application. I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics
                    Engineering from Mai-Nefhi Eritrean Institute of Technology (EIT). 
                    <br> <Br></Br> <h1>Why I Started this Blog?</h1>
                    <br>The
                    project of creating an application and website designing came as an idea before two years, after the
                    release of the
                    magazine named Mentor Megazine stopped from releasing, where I used to participate there in the design and
                    layout for one year. I
                    really appreciate the devotion and dream of the mentor volunteer group, which aims to help students
                    in their studies and
                    help them follow their passion. So, as we don't want the dream to fade, we are starting this webpage
                    and application, so
                    that we all Eritreans share our knowledge and help each other. 
                    <br><br><br><h1>The Message</h1><br> We don't have to wait to be great and
                    start sharing, we
                    just have to start sharing to be great. Since we all have something to share, so we really look your participation in making this blog a
                    useful page to all
                    Eritreans who are following their studies and seeking helps. So please send your articles you think
                    they are important
                    to be shared and projects.</p>

                    <h1>Our Greatest Fear</h1>
                    <p>It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us <br>
                        Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate <br>
                        Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure<br>
                        It is our light not our darkness that most frighten us<br>
                        We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?<br><br>
                        Actually, Who are you not to be?<br>
                        You are a child of God.<br>
                        Your palying small doesn't serve the world<br>
                        There is nothing enlightened about shrinking<br>
                        So that other people won't feel insecure about you.<br><br>
                        We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.<br><br>
                        It's not in some of us: it's in everyone. <br>
                        And as we let our own light shine<br>
                        we unconsciously give other people<br>
                        permission to do the same.<br><br>
                        As we are liberated from our own fear,<br>
                        Our presence automatically liberates others.<br><br>
