            <h1>Why do we cry when we chop onions?</h1>
            <p class="newsone">When any vegetable is damaged, its cells are ripped open. The plant often then tries to defend itself by releasing
            bitter-tasting chemicals called polyphenols that can be off-putting to hungry animals trying to eat it.
            
            But an onion's defence mechanism goes further, producing an even more irritating chemical, propanthial s-oxide, meant to
            stop the plant being consumed by pests.
            <br>
            <br>
            This volatile chemical is what's known as a lachrymatory factor. Its volatility means that, once it's released, it
            quickly evaporates and finds its way into our eyes. There it dissolves in the water covering the surface of our eyes to
            form sulphenic acid.
            
            This irritates the lacrimal gland also known as the tear gland, hence the rather grand name of lachrymatory factor.
            Because the amount of acid produced is so small, its effect is only irritating and not harmful.
            <br>
            <br>
            The release of propanthial s-oxide was originally thought to be down to one enzyme in the onion known as allicinase, a
            biological catalyst that speeds up the production of the eye-irritating compound. This more complex explanation starts with the sulphur the onion absorbs from the ground and holds in a compound called
            PRENCSO 1 (1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide).
            
            When the onion is damaged it releases the allicinase, which reacts with the PRENCSO to produce ammonia and another
            chemical called 1-propenylsulphenic acid.
            
            The second enzyme, known as a lachrymatory-factor synthase, then turns this into the troublesome propanthial s-oxide.
            <br>
            <br>
            So why do some onions have more of an eye-stinging effect than others? There is lots of debate about this.
            
            One plausible explanation is that it's related to the amount of sulphur the onion has absorbed from the ground, which
            can depend on the soil and the growing conditions. Higher levels of sulphur in the soil help boost both the yield and
            pungency of onions.
            
            Certainly sweeter onions tend to have less of the sulphur-containing compounds that eventually produce the propanthial
            s-oxide. But it's also possible that no two onions from the same bag will have the same effect, so cutting into the
            vegetable may be the only way to know if it will make you cry.
        <br>
    <br>
    One solution to the crying problem may be to re-engineer the humble onion by selective breeding or genetic modification
    to suppress the lachrymatory-factor synthase enzyme.
    
    This might also have the added benefit of improving how onions taste as less propanthial S-oxide would mean more
    thiosulphinate, the compound associated with the flavour of fresh onions.
    
    There are also a number of lower-tech solutions that have been suggested to solve the onion-chopping problem. As the
    reaction involves enzymes, the rate of reaction and amount of irritating chemicals produced can be cut by either
    damaging the enzymes or slowing them down.
    
    In theory, blanching the onions (scalding them with boiling water then plunging them into freezing cold water) will
    denature the enzymes involved and so prevent the reaction from happening.
    <br>
    <br>
    This method is used when freezing many vegetables but it may not be practical to boil your onions before chopping them.

Slowing the reaction can be achieved by by putting your onions in the fridge or freezer before chopping.

But it's best not to store onions in a fridge in the long term as they become soggy and soft and lose their flavour, as well as making an unpleasant smell.

It is best to keep your onions in a cool dark place with air flow that is not as humid as the fridge.

The ConversationOther approaches involve drawing the volatile chemicals away from you as you are chopping the onion. This could be done by using a cooker hood or running water, stopping the compounds making their way to your eyes.

You can even buy goggles to stop the irritant reaching your eyes. But the ability of evaporated propanthial s-oxide to reach our eyes regardless means that even then you should be prepared to weep as you slice.

            <h1>Why the sky has blue color?</h1>
            <p class="newsthree"> Like most curious people, you have probably asked at some time, “Why is the sky blue?” Or if you saw a beautiful sunset
            or sunrise, you might have asked, “Why is the sky red?”
            
            It’s so obvious that the sky is blue, you might think the reasons would be just as obvious. They aren’t! Of all the
            colors of the rainbow, why blue?
            
            Couldn’t the sky just as easily be green? Or yellow? When we see a rainbow, we do see green and yellow in the sky, as
            well as blue, violet, orange, yellow, red, and everything in between.
            
            The white light coming from the Sun is really made up of all the colors of the rainbow. We see all those colors when we
            look at rainbows. Raindrops act as tiny prisms when lit by the Sun, bending light and separating it into its different
            colors.
        <br><br>
    But why are there different colors? The light you see is just one tiny bit of all the kinds of light energy beaming
    around the Universe - and around you! Like energy passing through the ocean, light energy travels in waves, too. What
    makes one kind of light different from others is its wavelength - or range of wavelengths. Visible light includes the
    wavelengths our eyes can see. The longest wavelengths we can see look red to us. The shortest wavelengths we can see
    look blue or violet.
<br><br>
The wavelengths in this picture are not to scale. A red light wave is about 750 nanometers, while a blue or violet wave
is about 400 nanometers. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. A human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick! So
these visible light wavelengths are very, very tiny.

<br><br>
As the white light from the Sun enters Earth’s atmosphere, much of the red, yellow, and green wavelengths of light
(mixed together and still nearly white) pass straight through the atmosphere to our eyes. The blue and violet waves,
however, are just the right size to hit and bounce off of the molecules of gas in the atmosphere. This causes the blue
and violet waves to be separated from the rest of the light and become scattered in every direction for all to see. The
other wavelengths stick together as a group, and therefore remain white.
<br><br>
So what happens to all the “non-blue” wavelengths? They are still mixed together, unscattered by the atmosphere, so they
still appear white. The scattered violet and blue light dominates the sky, making it appear blue. What happens to the
violet? Some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. Also, our eyes are not as sensitive to violet as
they are to blue.

Closer to the horizon, the sky fades to a lighter blue or white. The sunlight reaching us from the horizon has passed
through even more air than the sunlight reaching us from overhead. The molecules of gas have rescattered the blue light
in so many directions so many times that less blue light reaches us.

            <h1>Why do we open our mouth when an airplane passes over our head?</h1>
            <p class="newstwo"> The theory goes that if you are in the vicinity of a concussive blast or a loud noise creator, that your eardrums may rupture if
            your mouth is tightly closed. The idea is that if your mouth (and presumably your nose) is closed and not in contact
            with the air outside, they form a closed chamber. Since your middle ears are continuous with the back of the nasal
            cavity (nasopharynx) by way of the auditory/Eustacean tubes, they are also part of this closed chamber. Normally this
            chamber would be at the same pressure as the air outside since we don't ascend or descend too quickly without opening
            our mouth/yawning/chewing to equalize the pressures. <br> <br>
            
            If a sudden compressive blast occurs, then the outside air pressure may slam in to the ear drum and pushes very hard on
            it from the outside. The pressure inside the middle ear is unable to push back effectively (lower pressure air) and the
            ear drum ruptures. By keeping your mouth open, the compressive wave also travels through the air in your mouth, nose,
            and middle ear, hitting the eardrum around the same time as the outside blast (pressure waves are fast). </p>
