                    <h1>How Everything Has Changed, Except Human Nature</h1>
                    <p>No relationships should be taken for granted. They are what life is all about, the
                        whole point. How we cultivate our relationships is often the greatest determinant of
                        the type of life we get to live. Business is no different. Real business isn’t done in
                        board meetings; it’s done over a half-eaten plate of buffalo wings at the sports bar,
                        or during the intermission of a Broadway show.
                        The only thing that will never change is human nature. When given the choice,
                        people will always spend their time around people they like. They’d also rather do
                        business with and buy stuff from people they like.
                        And now, they can. Social media has made it possible for consumers to interact
                        with businesses in a way that is often similar to how they interact with their friends
                        and family. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>Social Media</h1>
                    <p>It is imperative that brands and businesses learn how to properly and authentically
                        use social media to develop one-to-one relationships with their customer base no
                        matter how big, so that they make an impact in their market, now and in the future.
                        Finally, a way to really connect with our customers, an opportunity to hear what
                        they want, what they think, how things went, how our product worked, or how it
                        didn’t!<br>
                        If it’s true that one-to-one is quickly becoming one of the most important ways to
                        reach customers, then it means a massive number of businesses are eventually
                        going to have to undergo a total cultural transformation to compete.
                        Consumer expectations are changing dramatically, and social media has altered
                        everything about how companies must—MUST—relate to their customers. From
                        now on, the relationship between a business and a customer is going to look very
                        different from the way it has looked in the recent past.</p>

                    <h1>More than Social Media</h1>
                    <p>Social Media = Business The thing to keep in mind at all costs, though, is that the
                        Thank You Economy is much, much bigger than social media. Social media’s arrival
                        was simply the catalyst for a revolution that was already brewing in the minds of
                        consumers sick to death of feeling isolated, unappreciated, and ignored. The Thank
                        You Economy explains how businesses must learn to adapt their marketing
                        strategies to take advantage of platforms that have completely transformed
                        consumer culture and society as a whole.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>Erasing Lines in the Sand</h1>
                    <p>Corporate America loves ecommerce now, of course, but business leaders and
                        brand managers and marketers have simply drawn new lines in the sand, this time
                        putting distance between their companies and social media, all the while
                        desperately clinging to the security they still believe numbers can provide.
                        Unfortunately, if you wait until social media is able to prove itself to you before
                        deciding to engage with your customers one-on-one, you’ll have missed your
                        greatest window of opportunity to move ahead of your competitors.
                        Right now, I’d say that social media is a bit like a kidney, you can survive with only
                        one, but your chances of making it to old age are a lot better with two. Eventually,
                        though, I think social media will be as important to a business as a strong heart.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="parathree">
                <h1>Why Smart People Dismiss Social Media, and Why They Shouldn’t</h1>
                <p>Overall, there are eleven excuses I’ve heard companies use again and again to
                    justify their refusal to fully commit to and invest in social media, and I want to
                    dissect them all.
                    <br>1. There's no ROI. There is proven ROI in doing whatever you can to turn your
                    customers into advocates for your brand or business. In the Thank You
                    Economy, a key component of superior customer service is one-to-one
                    engagement in social media. It’s what customers want, and as we all know, the
                    customer is king.
                    <br>2. The metrics aren't reliable The tools for tracking and measuring social media
                    initiatives are becoming increasingly sophisticated and reliable.
                    <br>3. Social media is still too young First-to-market in this hyper-fast world has
                    impact.
                    <br>4. Social media is just another trend that will pass If users one day abandon
                    Facebook in favor of something better, they won’t be jumping off the train,
                    they’ll simply be moving to a new car. Move with them.
                    <br>5. We need to control our message A lot of companies resist building a Facebook
                    wall etc. because an irate customer might post negative comments. So what?
                    Would you prefer that the customer post them somewhere else where you have
                    absolutely no way to reply?
                    <br>6. I don't have time to keep track/don't want to pay someone else to. If you are a
                    one-person company and you want to grow your business, you’re going to have
                    to make time to track conversations yourself because you simply can’t afford
                    not to. Being a part of the conversation is as important as having a website.
                    <br>7. We're doing fine without it A competitive company is always on the offense.
                    Always. Always. Always.
                    <br>8. We tried it; it does't work You can’t reap the benefits of social media’s word of
                    mouth without a ton of patience, as well as commitment and strategy.
                    <br>9. The legal issues are too thorny To allow yourself to be pressured to give up
                    before you even start, without exploring every possibility, is inexcusable.
                    <br>10. It takes too long to pay off The long-term benefits of engaging with customers
                    will almost always lose out to the short-term reality, which is that people want
                    to keep their jobs.
                    <br>11. Social media only works for start-ups, life style or tech brands It’s true that
                    some products are sexier than others, but it’s also true that if there weren’t a
                    need for your product, you wouldn’t be in business.</p>

                    <h1>HOW TO WIN</h1>
                    <h1>From the Top: Install the Right Culture</h1>
                    <p>Success in the Thank You Economy hinges on obsessively caring about the
                        customer, yes, but a great caring culture stems from the top of a company and
                        cascades through it like a waterfall. If you want that culture to flow outside of the
                        company to the customer, and then get carried even farther by word of mouth, you
                        have to be sure that your messengers live and breathe it the same way you do.
                        Therefore, the dominant obsession for any leader running a company in the Thank
                        You Economy shouldn’t be the competition, nor should it be customer service. It
                        should be your employees.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>Happy Employees</h1>
                    <p>The first thing that makes an employee happy is being treated like an adult. They
                        should be allowed to manage their job as they see fit.
                        The second is feeling that his or her individual needs are being met. This is rare. To
                        achieve this kind of satisfaction among staff would require business leaders to
                        engage at the same one-on-one level with their employees as with their
                        customers.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="parafive">
                <div class="first">
                    <h1>Cultural Building Blocks</h1>
                    <p>For a mid-to-large company, being an effective CEO would require getting to know
                        a massive number of people on an individual level, wouldn’t it? Absolutely. It would
                        be do able if all the other cultural building blocks to a Thank You Economy company
                        had been established. If a leader were so inclined, here’s how it could be done:
                        <br>1. Begin with yourself - strong self-awareness makes a strong culture possible.
                        <br>2. Set the tone - send a strong, direct message about your intent. Employees
                        should be able to feel the difference immediately.
                        <br>3. Invest in employees - prove that you value your employees above all else by
                        giving them the freedom to ask for what they want, to experiment, and to be
                        themselves.
                        <br>4. Trust your people - begin hiring people who share your commitment to caring,
                        hire people you relate to and can trust.
                        <br>5. Be authentic - people can smell BS a mile away.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>The Perfect Date: Traditional Media Meets Social</h1>
                    <p>If you were on a date, and there was some serious chemistry, you wouldn’t let it
                        end at the restaurant. You’d probably suggest continuing your conversation over
                        drinks or coffee or an ice-cream cone.
                        Combining traditional and social media can allow you to do the same thing when
                        talking to people about your brand.
                        Develop creative work that allows the platforms to rally, to work together to extend
                        your story, continue the conversation, and connect with your audience.
                        It’s not enough to simply throw a Twitter or Facebook logo at the bottom of your ad,
                        or show Facebook.com/yourbrand at the end of your TV commercial.
                        What you might do instead is post a creative image or text, including your actual
                        address on Facebook and Twitter, that piques the consumer’s interest enough to
                        go there to see what else you have to say. Pull the viewers in, and keep the
                        conversation going for as long as you can.</p>

            <div class="parasix">
                <div class="first">
                    <h1>Intent: Quality versus Quantity</h1>
                    <p>I strongly believe that if your intentions are good, it shows, and it draws people to
                        you. Good intentions create a pull.
                        If you’ve ever considered embarking on a social media campaign, or even tried an
                        initiative or two, what was your intent? Was your goal to get someone to click
                        through or click the “Like” button? Or was it to build your online identity and foster a
                        connection between yourself and the consumer? If your answer is the former,
                        you’ve just hit upon the reason why most campaigns fail to meet their potential.
                        Social media works best when you evoke an emotion in the people to whom you’re
                        reaching out. It pulls. If you’re going to launch a campaign, it has to be one that
                        evokes an emotion—positive or negative—so that people feel compelled to share.
                        Give them something to talk about, unleash the power of word of mouth, and allow
                        them to pull you into their consciousness.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>Shock and Awe</h1>
                    <p>The money spent on shock and awe can have much more value than a Facebook ad
                        or even an CEO manager’s salary. Big companies, with their big marketing and
                        advertising budgets, can do amazing shock and awe, of course.
                        What’s cool is that you can scale shock and awe, and still create a magical,
                        chemical reaction. For example, what if you made a list of the twenty or thirty
                        customers who support your business the most, and sent each of them a
                        handwritten thank you note with a rose, or some other small gift? This would be a
                        low-cost yet high-impact move.</p>
