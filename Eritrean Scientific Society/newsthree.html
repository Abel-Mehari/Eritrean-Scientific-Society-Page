                    <h1>THE MIND SET<br>
                        Becoming a member of the club</h1>
                    <p>You can see proof that success breeds success and, indeed, the rich do get richer.
                        It's all about the web of friends and associates. Poverty, you come to realise, isn't
                        only a lack of financial resources; it is isolation from the kind of people that could
                        help you make more of yourself.<br>
                        Life, like golf, is a game, and that the people who know the rules, and know them
                        well, play it best and succeed. And the rule in life that has unprecedented power is
                        that the individual who knows the right people, for the right reasons, and utilizes
                        the power of these relationships, can become a member of the "club," whether he
                        started out as a caddie or not. <br>
                        To achieve your goals in life, it matters less how smart you are, how much innate
                        talent you're born with, or even, most eye- opening to me, where you came from
                        and how much you started out with. Sure all these are important, but they mean
                        little if you don't understand one thing: You can't get there alone. In fact, you can't
                        get very far at all.</p>

                    <h1>Business and networking</h1>
                    <p>Success in any field, but especially in business, is about working with people, not
                        against them. No tabulation of dollars and cents can account for one immutable
                        fact: Business is a human enterprise, driven and determined by people.<br>
                        People who instinctively establish a strong network of relationships have always
                        created great businesses. If you strip bussiness down to its basics, it's still about
                        people selling things to other people.</p>
                </div>

                    <h1>Self-help: a Misnomer</h1>
                    <p>Real networking was about finding ways to make other people more successful. It
                        was about working hard to give more than you get.
                        Of course, building a web of relationships isn't the only thing you need to be
                        successful. But building a career, and a life, with the help and support of friends
                        and family and associates has some incredible virtues.
                        <br>1. It's never boring. Time-consuming, sometimes; demanding, perhaps. But dull,
                        never. You're always learning about yourself, other people, business, and the
                        world, and it feels great.
                        <br>2. A relationship-driven career is good for the companies you work for because
                        everyone benefits from your own growth— it's the value you bring that makes
                        people want to connect with you.
                        <br>3. Connecting—with the support, flexibility, and opportunities for selfdevelopment that come along with it—happens to make a great deal of sense in
                        our new work world. The loyalty and security once offered by organizations can
                        be provided by our own networks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>What's your mission?</h1>
                    <p>Do you want to become a CEO or a senator? Rise to the top of your profession or to
                        the top of your child's school board? Make more money or more friends?
                        The more specific you are about what you want to do, the easier it becomes to
                        develop a strategy to accomplish it. Part of that strategy, of course, is establishing
                        relationships with the people in your universe who can help you get where you're
                        going.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="parathree">
                <div class="first">
                <h1>Don't keep score</h1>
                <p>Almost everyone has had to reach out for help to get a job interview, an internship,
                    or some free advice. And most have been reluctant to ask. Until you become as
                    willing to ask for help as you are to give it, however, you are only working half the
                    equation.
                    That's connecting. It's a constant process of giving and receiving of asking for
                    and offering help. By putting people in contact with one another, by giving your
                    time and expertise and sharing them freely, the pie gets bigger for everyone.
                    A network functions precisely because there's recognition of mutual need. There's
                    an implicit understanding that investing time and energy in building personal
                    relationships with the right people will pay dividends.
                    But to do so, first you have to stop keeping score. You can't amass a network of
                    connections without introducing such connections to others with equal fervor.
                    The more people you help, the more help you'll have and the more help you'll have
                    helping others.
                    Relationships are solidified by trust. Institutions are built on it. You gain trust by
                    asking not what people can do for you, to paraphrase an earlier Kennedy, but what
                    you can do for others. In other words, the currency of real networking is not greed
                    but generosity.</p>

                        Coming up with goals, updating them, and monitoring our progress in achieving
                        them is less important, than the process of emotionally deciding what it is you
                        want to do.</p><br>
                        <h1>Step One: find your passion</h1>
                    <p>-Before you start writing down your goals, you'd better know what your dream is.
                        <br>-Conduct an internal review. The important thing is to do so without the
                        constraints. Set aside the obstacles of time, money, and obligation.
                        <br>-Ask the people who know you best what they think your greatest strengths and
                        weaknesses are. Ask them what they admire about you and what areas you may
                        need help in.</p>

                    <h1>Step Two: putting goals to paper</h1>
                    <p>-Firstly, the development of the goals. List what you'd like to accomplish in the
                        next 3 years, work backwards in yearly, monthly increments to develop shortterm goals that will help reach your mission.
                        <br>-Secondly, connect those goals to the people, places, and things that will help
                        you get the job done. Name people that will help you get to the goals you have
                        outlined.
                        <br>-Thirdly, determine the best way to reach out to the people who will help you to
                        accomplish your goals.
                        Your goals must be specific, believable, challenging and demanding.</p>

                    <p>It helps to have an enlightened counselor, or two or three, to act as both
                        cheerleader and eagle-eyed supervisor, who will hold you accountable. They may
                        be made up of family members; perhaps someone who's been a mentor to you;
                        even an old friend or two.</p>

                <div class="second">
                    <h1>The Art of Small Talk</h1>
                    <p>The fact is that small talk—the kind that happens between two people who don't
                        know each other—is the most important talk we do. Language is the most direct
                        and effective method for communicating our objectives.
                        The goal is simple: Start a conversation, keep it going, create a bond, and leave
                        with the other person thinking, "I dig that person."
                        <br>-Be yourself. I believe that vulnerability—yes, vulnerability—is one of the most
                        under-appreciated assets in business today.
                        <br>-Power, today, comes from sharing information, not withholding it.
                        <br>-Learn the power of non-verbal cues. Smiles, eye contact, crossed arms, leaning
                        in etc.
                        <br>-Develop conversational currency. Be prepared to say something, keep up with
                        current events etc.
                        <br>-In order to establish a lasting connection, small talk needs to end on an
                        invitation to continue the relationship.</p>

                    <h1>The genius of audacity</h1>
                    <p>Audacity in networking has the same pitfalls and fears associated with dating 
                        which I'm not nearly as good at as I am the business variety of meeting people.
                        Sticking to the people we already know is a tempting behavior. But unlike some
                        forms of dating, a networker isn't looking to achieve only a single successful union.
                        Creating an enriching circle of trusted relationships requires one to be out there, in
                        the mix, all the time.
                        Most of us don't find networking the least bit instinctive or natural. Of course, there
                        are individuals whose inherent self- confidence and social skills enable them to
                        connect with ease. Then there are the rest of us.
                        Mustering the audacity to talk with people who don't know me often simply comes
                        down to balancing the fear of embarrassment against the fear of failure and its
                        repercussions.
                        Ultimately, everyone has to ask himself or herself how they're going to fail. We all
                        do, you know, so let's get that out of the way. The choice isn't between success
                        and failure; it's between choosing risk and striving for greatness, or risking nothing
                        and being certain of mediocrity.</p>

                        see a web of friendships to fall back on, not the ashes of bad encounters. Here are a
                        few rules to ensure that you never become a Network- ing Jerk:
                    <br>1. Don't schmooze.
                    <br>2. Don't rely on the currency of gossip.
                    <br>3. Have something to offer, don't show up empty handed.
                    <br>4. Treat everyone equally, don't treat those under you poorly.
                    <br>5. Be transparent. Be genuine.
                    <br>6. Don't be too efficient. Nothing is worse than a mass email.</p>

                        Do your homework</h1>
                    <p>Whom you meet, how you meet them, and what they think of you afterward should
                        not be left to chance. Preparation is key.
                        Before you meet with any new people research who they are and what their
                        business is. What's important to them: their hobbies, challenges, goals—inside
                        their business and out. Before the meeting, prepare, a one-page synopsis. Aim to
                        know what this person is like as a human being, what he or she feels strongly
                        about, and what his or her proudest achievements are.
                        These days, research is easy, the internet is a one-stop shop.
                        Once again, your goal in such a setting is to transform what could be a forgettable
                        encounter into a blossoming friendship. There are no shortcuts. You won't be able
                        to reach out to these individuals, and truly connect, without doing your homework.</p>

                        one heck of an information overload. How do you manage it? Keep a list. Create a
                        database and categorise into groups. Close friends, family, associates, people you

                    <p>So how do you manage a cold call?<br>
                        First, it's all about attitude. Your attitude. You're never going to be completely ready
                        to meet new people; there is no perfect moment. Your fears will never be
                        completely quieted, because inviting rejection is never going to be appealing.<br>
                        There are always a hundred reasons to procrastinate. The trick is to just plunge
                        right in. Remember, if you don't believe you are going to get what you want from the
                        call, you probably won't. You have to envision yourself winning to win.
                        And second, cold calls are for suckers. Don't call cold—ever. Ensure every call you
                        make is a warm one. <br>
                        <h2>Warm calls</h2>
                        <br>-Establish credibility. No one will buy from you unless you establish trust. Having
                        a mutual friend or even acquaintance will immediately make you stand out from

                        them. What can you do for them?
                        <br>-Talk a little but say a lot. Make it quick, definitive and efficient.
                        <br>-Offer a compromise. Try for a lot—it will help you settle for what it is you really

                    <p>Half the difficulty in reaching out to others is actually reaching somebody at all.
                        First, make the gatekeeper an ally rather than an adversary. And never, ever get on
                        his or her bad side. Many executive assistants are their bosses' minority partners.
                        Don't think of them as "secretaries" or as "assistants." In fact, they are associates
                        and lifelines.
                        Always respect the gatekeeper's power. Treat them with the dignity they deserve.
                        If you do, doors will open for you to even the most powerful decision makers. What
                        does it mean to treat them with dignity? Acknowledge their help. Thank them by
                        phone, flowers, a note.</p>

                    <p>Invisibility is a fate far worse than failure. It means that you should always be
                        reaching out to others, over breakfast, lunch, whatever. It means that if one
                        meeting happens to go sour, you have six other engagements lined up just like it
                        the rest of the week.
                        Keep your social and conference and event calendar full. As an up-and-comer, you
                        must work hard to remain visible and active among your ever-budding network of

                    <p>The power of shared passion in bringing people together can be seen today in the
                        rising trend of blogs, or Web logs. Blogs are online journals, usually dedicated to an
                        individual's interests, containing commentary and links to relevant news and
                        information. Popular blogs attract like-minded legions to their sites.
                        Your passions and the events you build around them will create deeper levels of
                        intimacy. Pay attention to matching the event to the particular relationship you're

                    <h1>Follow up, or fail</h1>
                    <p>In such a fast-paced, digital world, it's incomprehensible that only a small
                        percentage of us decide to follow up once we've met someone new. When you
                        meet someone with whom you want to establish a relationship, take the extra little
                        step to ensure you won't be lost in their mental attic.
                        FOLLOW-UP IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN ANY FIELD. Making sure a new
                        acquaintance retains your name is a process you should set in motion right after
                        you've met someone. Give yourself between twelve and twenty-four hours after you
                        meet someone to follow up. For example, if you meet somebody on a plane, send
                        them an e-mail later that day.
                        But remember—and this is critical—don't remind them of what they can do for you,
                        but focus on what you might be able to do for them. It's about giving them a reason
                        to want to follow up.</p>

                        of like-minded people who can help you fulfil your mission and goals.
                        Tips on being a conference commando:
                        <br>1. Help the organiser, heck, BE the organiser.
                        <br>2. Listen. Better yet, speak.
                        <br>3. Know your targets.
                        <br>4. Breaks are not times to take a break. Network.
                        <br>5. Follow up.
                        <br>6. It's the people, not the speakers.</p>

                    <h1>Connecting with connectors</h1>
                    <p>It has become part of our accepted wisdom that six degrees is all that separates us
                        from anyone else in the world. How can that be? Because some of those degrees
                        (people) know many, many more people than the rest of us.
                        Call them super-connectors. We all know at least one person like this individual,
                        who seems to know everybody and who everybody seems to know.
                        In one word: Connect. In four better words: Connect with the connectors.</p>

                    <h1>Expanding your circle</h1>
                    <p>The most efficient way to enlarge and tap the full potential of your circle of friends
                        is, quite simply, to connect your circle with someone else's.
                        It's like the Internet, an interconnecting series of links in which each link works
                        collaboratively to strengthen and expand the overall community.
                        Such collaboration means seeing each person in your network as a partner. Like a
                        business in which cofounders take responsibility for different parts of the company,
                        networking partners help each other, and by extension their respective networks,
                        by taking responsibility for that part of the web that is theirs and providing access
                        to it as needed. In other words, they exchange networks. The boundaries of any
                        network are fluid and constantly open.</p>

                    <p>When you understand someone else's mission, you hold the key to opening the
                        door to what matters most to them. Knowing that will help you create deep, longlasting bonds.
                        Try to find out what motivations drives that person. It often comes down to one of
                        three things: making money, finding love, or changing the world.
                        There are a lot of things we can do for other people: give good advice, help them
                        wash their car, or help them move. But health, wealth, and children affect us in
                        ways other acts of kindness do not.</p>

                        Real power comes from being indispensable. Indispensability comes from being a
                        switchboard, parceling out as much information, contacts, and goodwill to as many
                        people in as many different worlds as possible. It's a sort of career-karma.
                        The best sort of connecting occurs when you can bring together two people from
                        entirely different worlds. The strength of your network derives as much from the
                        diversity of your relationships as it does from their quality or quantity.</p>

                        it "pinging." It's a quick, casual greeting, and it can be done in any number of
                        creative ways. Once you develop your own style, you'll find it easier to stay in touch
                        with more people than you ever dreamed of in less time than you ever imagined.
                        Yes, there's grunt work involved. Pinging takes effort. That's the tough part. You
                        have to keep pinging and pinging and pinging and never stop. You have to feed the
                        fire of your network or it will wither or die.<br>

                        others up the mountain along with and before you. Never let the prospect of a more

                    <p>1. Have a unique point of view. It's not just about being able to talk intelligently
                        about politics, sports, travel, science, or whatever you'll need as a ticket of
                        admission to any conversation. It's about having opinions on these topics.

                        Starting today, you've got to figure out what exceptional expertise you're going

                        one of the most effective strategies to get the best out of each and every individual. <br> I can't stress enough how powerful the process is and how important it is that you
                        give your respect and time to it. In return, you'll be more than compensated with
                        spirit, enthusiasm, trust, and empathy—all things that will ultimately far exceed the
                        value of any advice you gave.
                        If you take mentoring seriously, and give it the time and energy it deserves, you'll
