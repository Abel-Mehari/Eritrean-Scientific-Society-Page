                <p>
                    As any, transportation system whether it is air born, land or even water, should be on an
                    organized and safety approved system. The transportation system needs to obtain concrete
                    data in order to improve its overall efficiency both organization and customer wise. A vehicle
                    tracking is the basic requirement in all fleet management systems. In fleet management
                    system we aim to improve the quality and efficiency of the organization by identifying the
                    real-time locations of their vehicles on a map.
                    In this project we try to overcome the challenges of urban transportation and develop an
                    effective approach to intelligently manage the vehicles of an organization with an efficient
                    vehicle tracking system. This system is designed and implemented for tracking the
                    movement of any GPS receiver equipped vehicle from any location at any time as long as
                    you have an internet connection. It makes good use of the popular technology that combines
                    GSM and GPS application with a microcontroller. This will be easy to make and inexpensive
                    compared to others. The designed in-vehicle device works using Global Positioning System
                    (GPS) and sends the vehicle location to the central controlling unit via satellite. Once these
                    real-time locations are mapped on the server, the Global System for Mobile Communication
                    (GSM) can be used to communicate with the vehicle driver and turn off his engine if he is on
                    unauthorized place. A microcontroller is used to control the GPS and GSM modules.
                    This overall system is easy to deploy and provide effective management tool to
                    transportation authorities for optimal utilization of present resources with ease-of-use for the
                    commuter and most importantly to the monitoring and controlling authorities.
                    In addition this system can also be integrated with different technologies for additional
                    features and future developments.</p>

                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        The effective transportation system leads to the effective movement of goods and people,
                        which significantly contribute to the quality of life in every society. In the Heart of every
                        economic and social development, there is always a transportation system. Therefore rapidly
                        increasing vehicle population in Eritrea due to increase in population and economic upturn
                        lays a very high complex burden on metropolitan traffic management. These mass transit
                        facilities are operating with manual method of fleet management which in turn also affects
                        the vehicle’s organization by decreasing their controlling ability. Intelligent technology based
                        tracking & navigation system is still not used in such transportation. This results in more
                        effort to manage such a large system and dependency on manual methods which could be
                        prone to error.
                        This proposed paper is an attempt to design a tracking unit that uses the Global
                        positioning system (GPS) to determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of a vehicle
                        along the path. This information will be gathered by the Head Quarter with the help of
                        internet from satellite and it will be mapped. And with the help of Global system of mobile
                        communication (GSM) we can contact the driver. It also helps the Central controlling authority
                        to track down the fleets with its real-time location on map to manage it precisely
                        and optimally.
                        In this paper, a transportation management system is developed for enhancing transportation
                        services based on combination of GPS and GSM systems. GPS is used in positioning the
                        device while GSM is used as communication link between different modules.</p>

                    <h1>Problems we expect to solve by this research are</h1>
                    <p>
                        Since this technology can be used in private trucks or for public transportation the problems
                        will be discussed for both separately. It is known that there is a lot of trouble in the
                        transportation system, starting from accidents to the driving speed.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="parathree">
                <h1>For public</h1>
                <p>
                    Sometimes drivers drive fast just to meet their deadline (because they made a stop too long,
                    the car broke down or any other unscheduled move), which leads to accidents and we need to
                    keep them in check. Drivers will drive much safer if they know that there is someone
                    checking on them all the time. This system can show us that and we can contact that person
                    to let him know to drive faster or slower and leave nothing to chance or in the will of the
                    driver in order to make the journey safe.
                    In the occurrence of any accidents we will be notified because we have Google map which
                    shows us exactly where the bus is located at that precise moment. Obviously if that bus is in
                    an accident and it is lying on a side of a hill, or any other dangerous position, then we can
                    contact the police and ambulance and ask them to offer their immediate help. This is more
                    useful if nobody is around: this makes it our job to report it and reduce the damages done on
                    people or property.
                    There might also be a break down and we will see a sudden stop on the map which indicates
                    that there is something wrong, so, after a certain period of time, we can consider it a
                    breakdown and contact a mechanic. Especially if the bus is on a place without phone service,
                    due to the phone signal not reaching that area or lack of electricity which is needed to power
                    the telephone poles (known as BTS). The problem may also be a breakdown of the BTS.
                    Because even though cellular phones need signal from BTS the GPS tracker doesn’t need any
                    because it gets its information directly from satellites. This is very reliable since a lot of
                    governments and high ranked companies rely on satellites so the chances of an error
                    occurring is slim to none. So we can send them help where they can’t ask for it.</p>

                        Some companies need security, punctuality, and assurance of delivery and this technology
                        makes them be certain of their services and how they can improve or correct them.
                        Theft, if a vehicle is missing then as soon as we notice it’s not where it’s supposed to be we
                        can locate the place where it is at that moment in an instant. And since we are using GPS
                        location we can locate it as long as it’s on planet earth. The GPS trucker has its own battery6
                        Resume:
                        source so it can be hidden at any part of the vehicle thus making it impossible for anyone but
                        the authorized personnel to know where it’s hidden.
                        Delivery companies and other companies that are time sensitive, they need their deliveries
                        made on time. In cases like this we need the driver to have a constant speed with only certain
                        amount of stops. The driver knowing he is being watched then can’t cheat on the schedule or
                        makeup unrealistic excuses for his actions.
                        Some other companies may need their deliveries to be intact due to the value of the vehicle
                        contents or the danger of those contents they may cause to the public if they are not handled
                        with at most care and this need can be precisely monitored speed and monitoring if the driver
                        is taking all the precautions taken by this tech. This can give a peace of mind to the company
                        and society in general for having a safe environment.
                        Field service management: repair or maintenance companies normally have time schedules
                        and deadlines or emergency calls to meet. Therefore if they have many employees on the
                        field then this technology can locate the closest employee and notifying her/him where to go,
                        to see to those needs. Thus making the service fast and efficient not to mention would save
                        the company money for choosing the closest field worker.</p>

                    <h1>Hypotheses or Research questions</h1>
                    <p>
                        The first question that came up to our mind was how we can improve the fleet management
                        system of our country. Then as a group we came up with an idea to design a new and smart
                        fleet management system. The essence of our project is to navigate the where beings of
                        vehicles.
                        Our projects’ primary aim focuses on the governmental buses and the privately owned
                        organizational vehicles. For the governmental service providing buses, many of us spend our
                        time waiting for the bus to come to the bus station. For the privately owned mini-buses, what
                        we see is many traffickers going out from their main way, where they were assigned by the
                        traffic attendants. The organizational vehicles we are referring to includes police cars,
                        ambulance, or other non-governmental organizations which we need control over.
                        For the problems stated above we are suggesting to implement a project that will minimize
                        the illegal movement of public transportation and organizational vehicles.</p>

                    <h1>Methodology <br>
                        GPS Technology</h1>
                    <p>
                        A GPS tracking device is a reliable way to observe
                        an object in motion. It makes the necessary details such as location and time information
                        irrespective of the weather conditions available,
                        anywhere on or near the earth. The Passenger Information Systems exist in various cities
                        that use GPS (Global Positioning System) systems for bus tracking. This technology demands
                        line-of-sight between the receiver and the satellites. Ignoring this
                        condition makes the GPS signal attenuate. This limitation makes GPS unsuitable for bus
                        tracking systems inside a sub terrestrial bus station. These two major drawbacks can be
                        overcome by the proposed system as it involves RF transceiver that has a communication
                        range up to 1000m and demands neither line-of-sight communication nor satellite
                        communication.</p>

                        needed so the receiver would know its two dimensional location (longitude and

                        might be more than four satellites but it only increases the accuracy of positioning. This

                        As explained in our objective, if the fleet is of police department or ambulance the
                        attendant may order to go to the nearest.</p>
                    <h1>The vehicle module</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are 4 main parts that is the GSM
                        module, the GPS tracker, the
                        microcontroller and finally the LCD. The
                        main purpose of this module is to track the
                        vehicle and lay out instruction from the
                        head quarter’s module through the LCD
                        screen.</p>
                    <p>When the GPS receiver calculates the position of the vehicle with the aid of satellites, the
                        exact pin point of the car will be located. This location will be sent to the head quarter’s
                        receiver and the vehicles exact position will be detected at the server. The GPS system works
                        via satellite but unlike this system the data sent to the LCD 16x2 screen is sent through GSM
                        system. If the vehicle is outside any of its original trajectory the head quarter controller
                        will
                        send a warning through GSM to the LCD. But this screen can also be used as a way to assign
                        the vehicles’ route. In vehicles of rental cars or any other company vehicles in addition to the
                        GSM receiver,
                        ON/OFF circuit will be added to the ignition part of the engine. This part or device will be
                        activated through GSM signal if and only if the vehicle is out of its jurisdiction in any way
                        and the driver ignores the warning given by the official. This device can be used to contain
                        rental cars with in their parameters.</p>

                    <h1>Limitations</h1>
                    <p>
                        As any project this particular project has limitations as well. The projects limitations can be
                        divided into two main factors.<br>
                        1. The first factor is that the project is mainly dependent on a GSM connection system.
                        For a GSM connection to work properly different factors are needed like a proper
                        location for a good signal. Locations like trenches and mountain can block the signal
                        and lower the efficiency of the communication. A proper signal must be available for
                        the system to work properly. The signal towers responsible for the area must be
                        uninterrupted and fully functional. With the present power limitation in Eritrea
                        sometimes the vehicle needs to find a good reception area for us to shut off the
                        engine.<br>
                        2. The second factor is internet connection which is needed for this system to work. This
                        is a very important part if we are going to get the instantaneous location of a vehicle.
                        But considering the benefits of this system, paying for a good internet connection is a
                        small price to pay.<br>
