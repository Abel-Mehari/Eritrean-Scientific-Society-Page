                    <h1>1. HAVE A POWERFUL START TO YOUR DAY</h1>
                    <p>By learning to get up earlier, you can add more flexibility to your morning and enjoy
                        a better start to your day. It starts with a decision, followed by a target time and
                        commitment to your plan.
                        Change your sleep cycle in 15-minute increments at a time, for 3–4 nights. Once
                        you are comfortable with this small change, make another adjustment to your
                        wake-up time and pay attention to the time you go to bed.<br>
                        Once you have successfully adopted this new schedule take full advantage of your
                        new-found “me time” by investing in yourself. For instance, you could meditate,
                        read a self-help book or start a new exercise regime.</p>

                <div class="second">
                    <h1>2. CREATE CHECKLISTS</h1>
                    <p>There are two types of checklists and you’ll have to decide first which one to use,
                        before creating your list:
                        In the case of READ-DO, the checklist acts like a recipe. First, you read the item on
                        the list, then you act according to the item and then you move on to the next item.
                        The DO-CONFIRM checklist is a bit different. In this case, you do a task from your
                        own memory (or from experience) and then at some point you consult your
                        checklist to make sure that you did everything required.
                        Remember that creating a checklist is not enough. You should also keep the list upto-date based on any process changes or requirement changes. You can schedule
                        this activity to your calendar, so that you remember to do it or use an application
                        like Siri to remind you about the maintenance task.</p>

                    <h1>3. KEEP DISTRACTIONS AT BAY</h1>
                    <p>There are 3 types of distractions you are exposed to during the working day;
                        communication tools, other people and internal distractions.
                        Try manage social media and emails as best you can, set boundaries e.g. check
                        twice a day for 15–20 minutes only.
                        Whether it be family members at home or colleagues in your office make changes to
                        avoid distractions e.g. make do not disturb requests, change your location or invest
                        in noise-cancelling headphones or show up to the office earlier than everyone else.
                        Ensure you get enough sleep, takes breaks and are adequately fuelled so that you
                        don’t face ‘internal distractions’ such as wandering thoughts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>4. NEVER START YOUR DAY UNPLANNED</h1>
                    <p>Implement a habit of planning your day in advance. This way you know exactly what
                        you should be focusing on when your work day starts. Also, you don’t have to
                        operate from memory, since all the necessary tasks are laid out in front of you.</p>

                <h1>5. DRINK WATER</h1>
                <p>Drinking water has many health benefits, but there are some productivity benefits
                    too. A study made by The University of East London found that drinking water
                    improves your brain performance by 14%.
                    Make a decision to drink more water, starting today. Your body and brain will thank
                    you for that!</p>

                    <h1>6. KNOW HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME</h1>
                    <p>It’s useful to start tracking your time to see how you are spending your work day.
                        Once you know how you spend your days, start doing systematic changes so that
                        the productivity ratio (the percentage of productive time) of your day increases.
                        Realise where you are getting distracted, identify why and minimise these
                        distractions.s</p>

                    <h1>7. IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS AND DO THEM FIRST</h1>
                    <p>To define an important task, consider these options:<br>
                        1. The long-term effect of a task<br>
                        2. The short-term effect of a task<br>
                        In the first case, a task – when completed – can have a profound effect on your
                        future. Most likely, these kinds of tasks are the ones which you should focus on
                        now, even if the results materialize later.
                        The short-term effect can also play a big role, when prioritization is concerned.
                        Even if a task might not be significant to you, other people may still rely on your
                        input before they can move ahead.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h1>8. FOCUS ON ONE THING AT A TIME</h1>
                    <p>-Split the task into smaller, manageable pieces. This gives you much better focus
                        as you don’t have to handle too big an entity at once.
                        <br>-Create a plan to execute the task.
                        <br>-Control the distractions around you as much as possible. Close your e-mail
                        application, avoid spending time online and mute your cell phone.
                        <br>-Take advantage of time blocking when you do the task.</p>

                    <h1>9. BATCH SIMILAR TASKS TOGETHER</h1>
                    <p>Instead of peeking into your inbox every now and then, start batch-processing all
                        the e-mails at once, during pre-determined time windows.
                        Pick 3 times per day (once in the morning, once in the mid-afternoon, and once in
                        the evening), to process all e-mails at once, in 15–30 minute bursts.
                        This same batching strategy could be used elsewhere too, not just with your e-mail
                        messages: phone calls, social media, etc.</p>

                    <h1>10. DELEGATE, THE RIGHT WAY</h1>
                    <p>Not only does delegation help to level the workload, it also gives us more time to
                        focus on our important assignments, ensuring that unnecessary mistakes are
                        weeded out during the work phase.
                        First, make sure to document your work steps with enough detail so that the other
                        person can actually complete a task with success.
                        Then, take a test drive of those instructions, first by following them yourself, and
                        then by the person you are delegating your task to.
                        Make sure to define the deadline for the delegated task.
                        The last step is to have a regular follow-up on your task (by phone or by e-mail), so
                        that things move along smoothly.</p>

                    <h1>11. TAKE BREAKS</h1>
                    <p>Breaks are important for your productivity. Try to have a break that energizes you,
                        helping you to perform better on your assignments after the break. A few examples
                        are making a cup of tea, eating a healthy snack, getting some fresh air or a short
                        burst of exercise.</p>

                    <h1>12. CONTROL THE BUSYWORK</h1>
                    <p>-Learn to say no. Or at the very least, make sure you set the right expectations
                        towards the person who asks you to do something.
                        <br>-If you are bombarded by multiple ASAP (as soon as possible) tasks by multiple
                        people, figure out together whose work has the highest importance, then
                        proceed with the agreed-upon priorities.
                        <br>-If someone asks you to do a task, could you ask them to help you with your
                        other task in return?
                        <br>-Make sure to understand the true costs if a project or task gets delayed.
                        <br>-Be pessimistic with your time.</p>
